# Core Tech Capabilities
- [Frontend] HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN or Play CDN).
- [Logic] Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), Web Workers (if needed for timing precision).
- [File Handling] Ability to process large strings and eventually parse .txt or .md files.

# Approved Workflow Actions
- Generate semantic HTML structures with Neo-Brutalist utility classes.
- Create modular JS functions for word splitting, ORP calculation, and playback control.
- Implement keyboard event listeners (Space for play/pause, Arrow keys for speed).
- Optimize for static hosting (GitHub Pages).

# Performance Constraints
- No heavy frameworks (React/Vue) unless specifically requested later.
- Ensure the UI remains responsive and "jerk-free" during 500+ WPM playback.
